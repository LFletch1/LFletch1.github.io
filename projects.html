        <h2>Drink Launching Robot</h2>
        <h3>In Progress</h3>
        <p2>After working on a numerical analysis
            project with my mechanical engineering friend we decided we wanted to
            work on a project together. We decided a robot that delivers drinks to
            individuals on request would be an interesting and somewhat commical concept. 
            The robot is being built on Arduino and will have features such as 0 point turns
            and bluetooth.

        <h2>Personal Website</h2>
        <h3>2021</h3>
        <p2>This website! I wanted to learn some HTML/CSS to help prepare for my
            senior design class which often includes some form of Web-Dev. What
            better way to learn than make my own website, so here it is!

        <h2>WTAMU Covid-19 Data Web Scraper</h2>
        <h3>2021</h3>
        <p2>A small program to scrape Covid-19 infection data automatically from the WT website and store it
            into a CSV file. The data is then graphed on a bar chart. The current WT website only shows
            Covid-19 infection data for the past two weeks.

        <h2>Exercise Evaluations Program</h2>
        <h3>2019~2020</h3>
        <p2>This project was the result of my time as a Kilgore Undergraduate Researcher.
            I utilized OpenPose, a body tracking software which can create a body structure
            from a video or image. The points generated by OpenPose were then used to analyze
            an individuals movements throughout a workout. The squat was chosen as the exercise of
            focus due to its ease of evaluation from a single angle. Additionally, I consulted with a biomechanics
            professor on what to look for in bad squat form. I created a GUI to allow the user to easily
            see where the system was detecting errors. After the analysis, the user is displayed with various 
            stats from the exercise such as average repetition time, number of repetitions, and overall grade
            of the exercise. The program also maps the knee angle of each repetition to give the user the ability
            to visually compare each movement in the set. The project was not a traditional hypothesis based research project;
            however, I did learn many valuable lessons throughout the process.

        <h2>LLNL DSSI Project</h2>
        <p2>My internship at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory included being apart of the <a href="https://data-science.llnl.gov/dssi/class/2022">
            Data Science Summer Institute 2022 Cohort</a>. Myself and three other interns were tasked with applying 
            machine learning to create models to predict whether a ligand protein would bind with Covid-19 or not. We developed two
            prediction models. One trained on a tabular dataset comprised of characteristics of the protien. Here we applied a variety of
            classifcation algorithms such as logistic regression, SVM, k-NN, and random forests. The second model was developed by taking
            the spatial data of the protein and translating it to a graph. The atoms represented the nodes and the edges represented the 
            bonds. This enabled us to train a graph neural network (GNN) to create the prediction model. We were able to achieve an 82%
            accuracy on the test dataset. The project was implmented using scikit-learn, Pytorch, and various other python libraries.

        <h2>Walks - Senior Capstone Project</h2>
        <p2>Walks is the name of the web application my fellow group members and I developed for our senior capstone project. 
            The app was made to give users the ability to give other users access to their whereabouts when going on hikes 
            or other outdoor adventures. Walks also allowed users to plan trips and invite other users to these trips.
            We not only utilized phones as GPS devices for the app, but we also integrated physical GPS devices produced
            by <a href="geoforce.com">geoforce</a> with our application. The web app was developed using React.js and Django
            along with a large amount of 3rd party APIs. The mobile application was developed through Swift, and the 
            whole application was deployed on an AWS EC2 server. We implemented an agile like development cycle throughout the
            project which included two week sprints and weekly meetings to discuss the project.

        <h2>WTAMU Covid-19 Data Web Scraper</h2>
        <p2>A small program to scrape Covid-19 infection data automatically from the WT website and store it
            into a CSV file. The data is then graphed on a bar chart. At the time the WT website would only show
            Covid-19 infection data for the previous two weeks.

        <h2>Exercise Evaluations Program</h2>
        <p2>This project was the result of my time as a Kilgore Undergraduate Researcher.
            I utilized OpenPose, a body tracking software which can create a body structure
            from a video or image. The points generated by OpenPose were then used to analyze
            an individuals movements throughout a workout. The squat was chosen as the exercise of
            focus due to its ease of evaluation from a single angle. Additionally, I consulted with a biomechanics
            professor on what to look for in improper squat form. I created a GUI to allow the user to easily
            see where the system was detecting errors. After the analysis, the user is displayed with various 
            stats from the exercise such as average repetition time, number of repetitions, and overall grade
            of the exercise. The program also maps the knee angle of each repetition to give the user the ability
            to visually compare each movement in the set. The project was not a typical research project;
            however, I did learn many valuable skills and lessons throughout the process.

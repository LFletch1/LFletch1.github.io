            Worked with Dr. Roger Pearce and Dr. Trevor Steil on develop network centralities for large scale graphs. Specifically
            looked at utilizing edge frequency in randomly generated spanning trees to detect bridge like edges. I am still currently
            working part time for LLNL on projects related to large scale graph algorithms.

        <h2>Software Engineer</h2>
        <h3>Texas Instruments: Summer 2021</h3>
        <p2>I spent the Summer within the Manufacturing Systems Solutions (MSS) group. I worked specifically
            as an applications developer on the mainframe team. There I developed and tested multiple COBOL applications
            that were needed for the lot history reporting system. Specifically these programs allowed for us to track
            the parametric historical data on lots and could be utilized for various product tracking reasons.

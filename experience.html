        <h2>Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory Computing Scholar</h2>
        <h3>WTAMU: May 2022 - Present</h3>
        <p2>
            Worked with Dr. Roger Pearce and Dr. Trevor Steil on developing network centralities for large scale graphs. 
            Additionally, participated in the <a href="https://data-science.llnl.gov/dssi/class/2022"> DSSI</a> program to work
            on applying ML to COVID-19 drug discovery. Specifically looked at utilizing edge frequency in randomly generated
            spanning trees to detect bridge like edges. Still currently working part time for LLNL on projects related to
            large scale graph algorithms.

        <p2>
            Worked with Dr. Vinitha Subburaj on a cross-disciplinary research project by implementing machine learning 
            and data analysis techniques to anti-microbrial material data. Created material performance prediction models to find 
            more effective anti-microbrial materials.
